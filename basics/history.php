                        PHP is the Web development language, PHP is a server-side scripting language, PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
                        The product was originally named Personal Home Page Tools, which can be embedded in HTML or used as a standalone binary
                        Rasmus Lerdorf : software engineer, Apache team member, is the creator and original driving force behind PHP
                        Developed a Perl/CGI script that enabled him to know how many visitors were reading his online résumé
                        The first part of PHP was developed for his personal use in late 1994,
                        To accomplish this, he opted to continue development in C code rather than Perl.
                        In November 1997 with the release of PHP 2.0, or Personal Home Page/Form Interpreter (PHP/FI), 
                        By the June 1998 release of version 3.0, more than 50,000 users were using PHP to enhance their Web pages.
                        At the beginning of 1999, Netcraft (http://www.netcraft.com/), an Internet research and analysis 
                        company, reported a conservative estimate of a user base of more than 1 million, making 
                        PHP one of the most popular scripting languages in the world
                    </p>

                        Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, the two Israeli programmers took the initiative to completely 
                        rethink the way PHP operated, culminating in a rewriting of the PHP parser, dubbed the 
                        Zend scripting engine. The result of this work was in the PHP 4 release. Zend.com (Zeev, Andi, Zend, get it?).
                        On May 22, 2000, roughly 18 months after the first official announcement of the new development 
                        effort, PHP 4.0 was released.

                        In its newest incarnation, PHP5 strives to deliver something many users have been clamoring
                        for over the past few years: much improved object-oriented programming (OOP) functionality.
                        PHP5’s newly rebuilt object model brings PHP more in line with other object-oriented languages such
                        as Java and C++, offering support for features such as overloading, interfaces, 
                        private member variables and methods, and other standard OOP constructions.
                        Try/catch exception handling, Improved XML and Web Services support, Native support for SQLite
